## What are we building?

Our idea is to create a database app where people can post their own random questions or facts about themselves to the home page and the names of who posted what will be hidden on another page with the name, FAC cohort (id as number) information by a reveal button as a starting point. 

## User stories

As a user, I want to: submit information to your site for anyone to see As a user, I want to: come back to your site later and see what I posted is still there

## Team members and roles

+ DevOps - Miah
+ Quality Assurance - Oli
+ User Experience - Milly
+ Scrum Facilitator - Adam

## Learnings
* Not having enough time to review progress and catch up. 
* Taking the time to read the docs and google errors is worth the time, trying to reverse engineer/modify workshop code can be counter productive to starting from scratch
* When running into errors or walls :person_climbing: research solutions together but all on our separate computers for time management :timer_clock:
